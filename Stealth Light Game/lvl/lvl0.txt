# every line in this file is a set of floors or walls
# only totally empty lines, and lines that begin with a '#' character are ignored

# standard form is 8 integers long:
# [wallOrientation(0 for floor),textureIndex,lowX,lowY,lowZ,highX,highY,highZ]
# x moves from right to left on the screen, y changes the layer, z moves from top to bottom
# lowX,Y,Z and highX,Y,Z are used to define a cube, where a sprite is
# assigned to every 'spot' that lies within the cube's boundaries

# this line makes a group of floors with texture 0 from (-5,0,-5) to (5,0,5)
0 0 -5 0 -5 5 0 5

# these lines make a ring of floors at y=1
0 1 -5 1 -5 5 1 -5
0 1 -5 1 5 5 1 5
0 2 -5 1 -4 -5 1 4
0 2 5 1 -4 5 1 4

# lines with only 5 elements are treated as a single spot
# this line places a single floor with texture 1 at (0,1,0)
0 2 0 1 0

# the wallOrientation element can be any integer from 1 to 8 (or 0 for floors)
# the wall normal will face outwards with an angle of (wallOrientation)*(pi/4)
# this places a group of walls facing towards the left from (-5,0,-5) to (-5,0,5)
4 1 -5 0 -5 -5 0 5

# this places a wall facing up-right at (3,0,-3) with texture 2
