COACH
	Welcome to the RADICAL HYPER MEGA TRACK!
	Now that you signed all the waivers,
	I can show you the functionality of your SWEET RIDE
	Check her out...
	Hop inside and I'll show you how to start the engine pods!
	First, hold down the igniter [Shift]
	While holding the igniter [Shift], accelerate with [W]!
	On these CUTTING-EDGE DEMONS OF SPEED,
	The engine pods are designed only to go FAST
	If you go too slow for too long,
	the pods will stall, and you will need to restart them!
	Activate the Main thruster with [W]
	Activate the side thrusters with [A] and [D], respectively.
	Levitate above obstacles with [Space]!
	And lastly, slow down with [S].
	Try navigating this course to complete your training!

COACH
	Your BODACIOUS controls are unplugged!
	Drag the power plugs to the controls to activate them.
	You are up against the ghost of the driver
	Who went out of control on this track!
	Be careful not to fall off the edge-
	Slow down before bends to avoid missing the sharp turn!
