	Welcome to the RADICAL HYPER MEGA TRACK!
	Now that you signed all the waivers,
	I can show you the functionality of your SWEET RIDE
	Check her out...
	Hop inside and I'll show you how to start the engine pods!
	First, hold down brake [S]
	While holding brake [S], start the igniter [Q]
	While holding the igniter [Q], release the brake, and accelerate [W]!
	On these CUTTING-EDGE DEMONS OF SPEED,
	The engine pods are designed only to go FAST
	If you go too slow for too long,
	the pods will stall, and you will need to restart them!
	Activate the Main thruster with [W]
	Activate the side thrusters with [A] and [D], respectively.
	Launch yourself into the air with [E]!
	And lastly, slow down and reverse with [S].
	Try navigating this course to complete your training!
